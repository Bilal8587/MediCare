## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a typical Gatsby project.
    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js

    └── tailwind.config.js

1.  */node_modules*: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  */src*: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for “source code”.

3.  *.gitignore*: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version for history.

4.  *gatsby-browser.js*: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

5.  *gatsby-config.js*: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

6.  *gatsby-node.js*: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

7.  *gatsby-ssr.js*: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

8.  *LICENSE*: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

9.  *package.json*: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

10.  *README.md*: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.



##  Note
- The project is currently *not responsive*, but fully functional.
- Only the frontend is implemented — no backend.
- Axios is used for fetching dynamic reviews from an API.
